ssh-gpg-smartcard-config for YubiKey 4 and YubiKey NEO
========================================

This document covers the procedure for configurating a YubiKey as a GPG smartcard for SSH authentication, it also covers setting the correct serial number on the card. The benefit is a good model for `two-factor authentication <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication>`_, something you have and something you know. In this example, there is a token and a passphrase.

The `YubiKey 4 or YubiKey 4 Nano <https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey4>` or `YubiKey Neo <https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey-neo>`_ are used here. Other YubiKeys will not work, as they do not support the applet functionality.

Examples below are using a Fedora 23 x86_64 and Ubuntu 15.04 x86_64 fresh install. There are other tutorials for other operating systems and keys available online. See the CREDITS section below for alternate tutorials, examples, etc.

Configuring Authentication with GNOME-Shell
-------------------------------------------
To configure authentication using the previously generated GnuPG key, the GNOME-Shell needs some adjustements. With help from several resources, configure the system to allow ``gpg-agent`` to take over SSH authentication.

Certain software must be installed, including utilities for the YubiKey ``libyubikey-devel`` (``libyubikey-dev`` on Ubuntu), ``gnupg2`` (which is probably already installed), ``gnupg2-smime`` (``gpgsm`` on Ubuntu)i, ``pcsc-lite-ccid``, and ``pcsc-lite`` (``pcscd`` and ``libpcsclite1`` on Ubuntu).

*Fedora*::

  $ sudo dnf install ykpers-devel libyubikey-devel libusb-devel \
     autoconf gnupg gnupg2-smime pcsc-lite pcsc-lite-ccid

*Ubuntu*::

  $ sudo apt-get install gnupg-agent gnupg2 pinentry-gtk2 scdaemon \
     libccid pcscd libpcsclite1 gpgsm yubikey-personalization \
     libyubikey-dev libykpers-1-dev

**Optional**: Install the `YubiKey NEO Manager GUI <https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-neo-manager/>`_. If running Ubuntu, you can install the YubiKey NEO manager and other YubiKey software from the `Yubico PPA <https://launchpad.net/~yubico/+archive/ubuntu/stable>`_.

Enable your YubiKeyâ€™s Smartcard interface (CCID)
-----------------------------------------------------
This will enable the smartcard portion of your YubiKey::
This is not required for YubiKey 4.

  $ ykpersonalize -m82

If you have a dev key, Reboot your YubiKey (remove and reinsert) so that ykneomgr works.

Configure GNOME-Shell to use gpg-agent and disable ssh-agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Turn off ssh-agent inside gnome-keyring-daemon::

  if [[ $(gconftool-2 --get /apps/gnome-keyring/daemon-components/ssh) != "false" ]]; then
    gconftool-2 --type bool --set /apps/gnome-keyring/daemon-components/ssh false
  fi

Configure GPG to use its agent (only for smartcard)::

  $ echo "use-agent" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf

Enable ssh-agent drop in replacement support for gpg-agent::

  $ echo "enable-ssh-support" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

Allow admin actions on your YubiKey (if your gnupg version is < 2.0.11)::

  $ echo "allow-admin" >>  ~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf

Intercept gnome-keyring-daemon and put gpg-agent in place for ssh authentication (Ubuntu)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Open Startup Applications

Uncheck "GPG Password Agent" and "SSH Key Agent"

.. image:: startup_apps_checked.png

Edit ``/usr/share/upstart/sessions/gpg-agent.conf`` so that the pre-start script contains the following::

  eval "$(gpg-agent --daemon --enable-ssh-support --sh)" >/dev/null
  initctl set-env --global GPG_AGENT_INFO=$GPG_AGENT_INFO
  initctl set-env --global SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$SSH_AUTH_SOCK
  initctl set-env --global SSH_AGENT_PID=$SSH_AGENT_PID

Add the following lines to the post-stop script section::

  initctl unset-env --global SSH_AUTH_SOCK
  initctl unset-env --global SSH_AGENT_PID

Disable the other system gpg-agent::

  mv /etc/X11/Xsession.d/90gpg-agent ~/bak/90gpg-agent

Note: We could have used the Xsession gpg-agent and trashed the upstart one, but there is an `open bug report <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=642021>`_ for 90gpg-agent. Also, the upstart script has the capability of exporting the environment variables globally with initctl set-env --global.

Intercept gnome-keyring-daemon and put gpg-agent in place for ssh authentication (Fedora)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
If running gnome, this problem may be solved by running the following to disable gnome-keyring from autostarting its broken gpg-agent and ssh-agent implementation::

  mv /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-gpg.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-gpg.desktop.inactive
    
  mv /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop.inactive

Next, place the following in ``~/.bashrc`` to ensure gpg-agent starts with ``--enable-ssh-support``
::

    if [ ! -f /tmp/gpg-agent.env ]; then
        killall gpg-agent;
        eval $(gpg-agent --daemon --enable-ssh-support > /tmp/gpg-agent.env);
    fi
    . /tmp/gpg-agent.env

Now go to next step (Reload GNOME-Shell) :)

Reload GNOME-Shell So that the gpg-agent stuff above takes effect. 
------------------

Rebooting the machine works the best.


Get gpshell etc to fix serial number*
--------------------------------
#\* This section not relevant to a consumer edition NEO, it can still be relevant to a developer edition NEO. This section has not been tested with Ubuntu.

Install gpshell binary and libs from tykeal's repo::

  $ sudo yum install http://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/tykeal/GlobalPlatform/fedora-19-x86_64/tykeal-GlobalPlatform-release-0.0.1-1.fc19/tykeal-GlobalPlatform-release-0.0.1-1.fc19.x86_64.rpm

  sudo yum install gpshell gppcscconnectionplugin


Create a gpinstall file::

  cat <<EOF >> gpinstall.txt
  mode_211
  enable_trace
  establish_context
  card_connect
  select -AID a000000003000000
  open_sc -security 1 -keyind 0 -keyver 0 -mac_key 404142434445464748494a4b4c4d4e4f -enc_key 404142434445464748494a4b4c4d4e4f
  delete -AID D2760001240102000000000000010000
  delete -AID D27600012401
  install -file openpgpcard.cap -instParam 00 -priv 00
  card_disconnect
  release_context
  EOF


Get the cap file and place it where gpinstall expects to find it::

  wget -O openpgpcard.cap https://github.com/Yubico/yubico.github.com/raw/master/ykneo-openpgp/releases/ykneo-openpgp-1.0.5.cap



put the correct serial number into gpinstall.txt:: 

  if ykneomgr -s; then
    sed -i "s/^install.*/& -instAID D276000124010200006"$(printf %08d "$(ykneomgr -s)")"0000/" gpinstall.txt
  fi


Flash the card\*::

  gpshell gpinstall.txt

#\* WARNING This erases all existing keys on the smartcard

#\* End section not relevant to a consumer edition NEO

Setting PINs
------------

Included with the gemalto token and GnuPG Smartcard version 2 should be a document describing the default PIN values. There is a regular PIN, which is used to unlock the token for Signing, Encryption or Authentication. Additionally, there is an admin PIN, which is used to reset the PIN and/or the Reset Code for the key itself.


Complete these steps for PIN and then Admin Pin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
default pins are 123456 and 12345678 respectivly 

::

  $ gpg2 --card-edit
  ..snip..

  gpg/card> admin
  Admin commands are allowed

  gpg/card> passwd
  gpg: OpenPGP card no. D27600012401020000050000158A0000 detected

  1 - change PIN
  2 - unblock PIN
  3 - change Admin PIN
  4 - set the Reset Code
  Q - quit

  Your selection? 3

Generating an SSH Key using GnuPG
---------------------------------

There are several ways to generate an SSH Key using GnuPG. A common way is to link the new authentication key to an already existing key::

  $ gpg2 --edit-key 8A8F1D53

  gpg>

Once in the ``edit-key`` dialog, create a key on the card::

  gpg> addcardkey
  Signature key ....: 91BC 60CC B9EC 8E73 923A  FC6D 58CD 88A6 2F15 E06B
  Encryption key....: 0CC3 DC3E 0D17 6111 A62B  F656 63C6 4DA9 EB8B 4EBD
  Authentication key: 9EBF A9FE 8AE1 0FEB 1699  CE9A 779F 43D5 EC6F CC13

  Please select the type of key to generate:
     (1) Signature key
     (2) Encryption key
     (3) Authentication key
  Your selection? 3
  
  IT WILL PROMPT YOU TO ENTER THE ADMIN PIN, AND THEN THE REGULAR PIN. Don't fat finger this part!

Upon completion of the key, be sure to save the record to the card and gpg key::

  gpg> save

Verify SSH key is managed via gpg-agent
---------------------------------------

Assuming everything above is configured correctly, a simple test is performed with the SmartCard inserted::

  $ ssh-add -L
  ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQDL/XmU......BL0luE= cardno:00050000158A
