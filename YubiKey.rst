ssh-gpg-smartcard-config for YubiKey 4 and YubiKey NEO
========================================

This document covers the procedure for configurating a YubiKey as a GPG smartcard for SSH authentication, it also covers setting the correct serial number on the card. The benefit is a good model for `two-factor authentication <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication>`_, something you have and something you know. In this example, there is a token and a passphrase.

The `YubiKey 4 or YubiKey 4 Nano <https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey4>` or `YubiKey Neo <https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey-neo>`_ are used here. Other YubiKeys will not work, as they do not support the applet functionality.

Examples below are using a Fedora 23 x86_64 and Ubuntu 15.04 x86_64 fresh install. There are other tutorials for other operating systems and keys available online. See the CREDITS section below for alternate tutorials, examples, etc.

Configuring Authentication with GNOME-Shell
-------------------------------------------
To configure authentication using the previously generated GnuPG key, the GNOME-Shell needs some adjustements. With help from several resources, configure the system to allow ``gpg-agent`` to take over SSH authentication.

Certain software must be installed, including utilities for the YubiKey ``libyubikey`` (``libyubikey-dev`` on Ubuntu), ``gnupg2`` (which is probably already installed), ``gnupg2-smime`` (``gpgsm`` on Ubuntu)i, ``pcsc-lite-ccid``, and ``pcsc-lite`` (``pcscd`` and ``libpcsclite1`` on Ubuntu).

*Fedora*::

  $ sudo dnf install ykpers libyubikey \
     gnupg gnupg2-smime pcsc-lite pcsc-lite-ccid

*Ubuntu*::

  $ sudo apt-get install gnupg-agent gnupg2 pinentry-gtk2 scdaemon \
     libccid pcscd libpcsclite1 gpgsm yubikey-personalization \
     libyubikey-dev libykpers-1-dev

**Optional**: Install the `YubiKey NEO Manager GUI <https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-neo-manager/>`_. If running Ubuntu, you can install the YubiKey NEO manager and other YubiKey software from the `Yubico PPA <https://launchpad.net/~yubico/+archive/ubuntu/stable>`_.

Enable your YubiKey’s Smartcard interface (CCID)
-----------------------------------------------------
This will enable the smartcard portion of your YubiKey::
This is not required for YubiKey 4.

  $ ykpersonalize -m82

If you have a dev key, Reboot your YubiKey (remove and reinsert) so that ykneomgr works.

Configure GNOME-Shell to use gpg-agent and disable ssh-agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Turn off ssh-agent inside gnome-keyring-daemon::

  if [[ $(gconftool-2 --get /apps/gnome-keyring/daemon-components/ssh) != "false" ]]; then
    gconftool-2 --type bool --set /apps/gnome-keyring/daemon-components/ssh false
  fi

Configure GPG to use its agent (only for smartcard)::

  $ echo "use-agent" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf

Enable ssh-agent drop in replacement support for gpg-agent::

  $ echo "enable-ssh-support" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

Allow admin actions on your YubiKey (if your gnupg version is < 2.0.11)::

  $ echo "allow-admin" >>  ~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf

Intercept gnome-keyring-daemon and put gpg-agent in place for ssh authentication (Ubuntu)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Open Startup Applications

Uncheck "GPG Password Agent" and "SSH Key Agent"

.. image:: startup_apps_checked.png

Edit ``/usr/share/upstart/sessions/gpg-agent.conf`` so that the pre-start script contains the following::

  eval "$(gpg-agent --daemon --enable-ssh-support --sh)" >/dev/null
  initctl set-env --global GPG_AGENT_INFO=$GPG_AGENT_INFO
  initctl set-env --global SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$SSH_AUTH_SOCK
  initctl set-env --global SSH_AGENT_PID=$SSH_AGENT_PID

Add the following lines to the post-stop script section::

  initctl unset-env --global SSH_AUTH_SOCK
  initctl unset-env --global SSH_AGENT_PID

Disable the other system gpg-agent::

  mv /etc/X11/Xsession.d/90gpg-agent ~/bak/90gpg-agent

Note: We could have used the Xsession gpg-agent and trashed the upstart one, but there is an `open bug report <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=642021>`_ for 90gpg-agent. Also, the upstart script has the capability of exporting the environment variables globally with initctl set-env --global.

Intercept gnome-keyring-daemon and put gpg-agent in place for ssh authentication (Fedora)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
If running gnome, this problem may be solved by running the following to disable gnome-keyring from autostarting its broken gpg-agent and ssh-agent implementation::

  mv /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-gpg.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-gpg.desktop.inactive
    
  mv /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop.inactive

Next, place the following in ``~/.bashrc`` to ensure gpg-agent starts with ``--enable-ssh-support``
::

    if [ ! -f /run/user/($id -u)/gpg-agent.env ]; then
        killall gpg-agent;
        eval $(gpg-agent --daemon --enable-ssh-support > /run/user/($id -u)/gpg-agent.env);
    fi
    . /run/user/($id -u)/gpg-agent.env

Now go to next step (Reload GNOME-Shell) :)

Reload GNOME-Shell So that the gpg-agent stuff above takes effect. 
------------------

Rebooting the machine works the best.


Get gpshell etc to fix serial number*
--------------------------------
#\* This section not relevant to a consumer edition NEO, it can still be relevant to a developer edition NEO. This section has not been tested with Ubuntu.

Install gpshell binary and libs from tykeal's repo::

  $ sudo yum install http://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/tykeal/GlobalPlatform/fedora-19-x86_64/tykeal-GlobalPlatform-release-0.0.1-1.fc19/tykeal-GlobalPlatform-release-0.0.1-1.fc19.x86_64.rpm

  sudo yum install gpshell gppcscconnectionplugin


Create a gpinstall file::

  cat <<EOF >> gpinstall.txt
  mode_211
  enable_trace
  establish_context
  card_connect
  select -AID a000000003000000
  open_sc -security 1 -keyind 0 -keyver 0 -mac_key 404142434445464748494a4b4c4d4e4f -enc_key 404142434445464748494a4b4c4d4e4f
  delete -AID D2760001240102000000000000010000
  delete -AID D27600012401
  install -file openpgpcard.cap -instParam 00 -priv 00
  card_disconnect
  release_context
  EOF


Get the cap file and place it where gpinstall expects to find it::

  wget -O openpgpcard.cap https://github.com/Yubico/yubico.github.com/raw/master/ykneo-openpgp/releases/ykneo-openpgp-1.0.10.cap



put the correct serial number into gpinstall.txt:: 

  if ykneomgr -s; then
    sed -i "s/^install.*/& -instAID D276000124010200006"$(printf %08d "$(ykneomgr -s)")"0000/" gpinstall.txt
  fi


Flash the card\*::

  gpshell gpinstall.txt

#\* WARNING This erases all existing keys on the smartcard

#\* End section not relevant to a consumer edition NEO

Setting PINs
------------

There is a regular PIN, which is used to unlock the token for Signing, Encryption or Authentication. Additionally, there is an admin PIN, which is used to reset the PIN and/or the Reset Code for the key itself.


Complete these steps for PIN and then Admin Pin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
default pins are 123456 and 12345678 respectivly 

::

  $ gpg2 --card-edit
  ..snip..

  gpg/card> admin
  Admin commands are allowed

  gpg/card> passwd
  gpg: OpenPGP card no. D27600012401020000050000158A0000 detected

  1 - change PIN
  2 - unblock PIN
  3 - change Admin PIN
  4 - set the Reset Code
  Q - quit

  Your selection? 3

Generating an SSH Key using GnuPG
---------------------------------

There are several ways to generate an SSH Key using GnuPG. A common way is to link the new authentication key to an already existing key::

  $ gpg2 --edit-key 8A8F1D53

  gpg>

Once in the ``edit-key`` dialog, create a key on the card::

  gpg> addcardkey
  Signature key ....: 91BC 60CC B9EC 8E73 923A  FC6D 58CD 88A6 2F15 E06B
  Encryption key....: 0CC3 DC3E 0D17 6111 A62B  F656 63C6 4DA9 EB8B 4EBD
  Authentication key: 9EBF A9FE 8AE1 0FEB 1699  CE9A 779F 43D5 EC6F CC13

  Please select the type of key to generate:
     (1) Signature key
     (2) Encryption key
     (3) Authentication key
  Your selection? 3
  
  IT WILL PROMPT YOU TO ENTER THE ADMIN PIN, AND THEN THE REGULAR PIN. Don't fat finger this part!

  gpg: WARNING: such a key has already been stored on the card!

  Replace existing key? (y/N) y
  What keysize do you want for the Authentication key? (3072)

Upon completion of the key, be sure to save the record to the card and gpg key::

  gpg> save
  $

Verify SSH key is managed via gpg-agent
---------------------------------------

Assuming everything above is configured correctly, a simple test is performed with the SmartCard inserted::

  $ ssh-add -L
  ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQDL/XmU......BL0luE= cardno:00050000158A
